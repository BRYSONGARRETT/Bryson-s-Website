                            Market Research - By completing an competitive analysis between these two well known apps,
                            this helped me distinguish the strengths and weaknesses of each app.
                            I understood what to implement and what to take out in Captain cook.
                            Again my main focus was to give users the common features they enjoy
                            but also add a little more that what the typical recipe app has to offer.

                        <h2>User Personas</h2>

                        </picture>
                        <p>
                            User personas were a great use of time because it helped prioritize the users
                            as the center point of my design. Always referring back to their goals or
                            frustrations constantly aided my design process. Another beneficial part was
                            that each user had different ideas/feedback to add.
                        </p>
                        <h2>User Flow</h2>
                        <picture>
                            <source srcset="./img/captaincook-image-userflow.jpg" media="(max-width:600px)">

                        <p>
                            The crucial part of a userflow in UI design is to ensure a seamless and intuitive
                            journey for the user as they interact with a digital product. This involves
                            identifying the key steps, actions, and decision points that users will encounter
                            while achieving their goals within the interface. My flows included food categories,
                            saving recipes, sharing recipes, meal planning, shopping lists and more.

                        <p>
                            Challenges along the way - Structuring the content in a logical and organized
                            manner was more complex than initially anticipated. Deciding on the best way
                            to categorize and present recipes, as well as providing search and filter options,
                            required thoughtful information userflow decisions.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Mid Fidelity Wire Frames</h2>

                        <p>
                            By incorporating this feedback into the mid-fidelity wireframes, I was able to make
                            important usability improvements before investing time and resources in creating
                            high-fidelity designs, ultimately leading to a more user-friendly and effective cooking
                            recipe app.

                            High Fidelity Wire Frames -
                            My High-fidelity wireframes are the polished and detailed visual representations of my
                            responsive web app.
                            I tried aiming to have a very basic/straight forward interface for any chef to potentially
                            use.
                            This all included design elements, colors, typography, etc
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The moodboard aims to convey a sense of wholesomeness, sustainability, and a connection to
                            nature,
                            making it a valuable source of inspiration for design projects related to food, wellness, or
                            eco-friendly products.
